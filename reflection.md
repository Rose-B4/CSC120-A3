Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    I briefly chatted with the person I was sitting next to (I'm so sorry I can't remember you name D: ) before class on 9/26
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    None
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Honestly, it just feels like C# with extra steps at the moment... I get the feeling I will like it once I get more used to it, but for now it just feels clunky 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    Even though Java is an object oriented language, you can use it as a functional language if you want. This program is technically made inside of an object, but at the end of the day it is almost entirely functional programming.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    Please make it way more clear that consulting with other students is a requirement for this assignment earlier or even at the same time as it's assigned (if it even is a requirement at all I'm still not quite sure)
- Other notes?
    It would be really cool to do this type of thing again later but using a json file to hold a bunch of mirror words instead of a 2d array. This could be a neat intro to data parsing if we get into different formats later in this class (or in another class)
